# Earthquake Data Visualization using Java
**This is the project that I created in my second semester in Objected Oriented Programming (OOP) subject**.

## Project Intro:
-  *data visualization* is one of the hot topics of modern computer science - as well as something that influences our world every day! 
- Earthquakes are happening daily around the world. Geological analysis suggests which locations will be prone to higher seismic activity.
- The impact of an earthquake depends on many factors, including whether the epicenter is over land or in the ocean. 
- In this project I built an interactive visualization of a large dataset tagged by geospatial information. Both powerful and challenging.
- I plotted recent earthquakes on a map to highlight potential disaster zones.
To create this project, I used a package called ***Unfolding Maps***, which is a library for interactive maps and geovisualizations.
- This Application reads earthquake data from a live ***RSS*** **(Really Simple Syndication)** feed **(an online source of frequently updated data in computer readable 	format).**
